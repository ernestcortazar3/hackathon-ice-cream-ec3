This README.md doc is intended to document my design process.

I created the initial GitHub Repository earlier today, and learned that every edit needs to be pushed after losing a few hours worth of preliminary work. :/

Today I have submitted the CSS Ransom Note assignment. I feel like I am so close to gathering vital technical skills to bring my original idea of an actual ice cream shop store like appearance to life, with shapes and such. I know what I don't know. and after not really knowing where to begin with the Ransom Note assingment, I feel like I don't really know what I know either.

This inspired a totally new design concept WAY out of the box. i(want to)Scream. I have gathered in the roughly two weeks of code experience that this is a shared experience amongst coders.

I am excited to test my fundamental, comprehensive knowledge of basic html and css concepts. and to also build a safe, structured platform to vent out some of my favorite frustrations.
