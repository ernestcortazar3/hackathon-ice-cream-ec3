This README.md doc is intended to document my design process.

I created the initial GitHub Repository earlier today, and learned that every edit needs to be pushed after losing a few hours worth of preliminary work. :/

Today I have submitted the CSS Ransom Note assignment. I feel like I am so close to gathering vital technical skills to bring my original idea of an actual ice cream shop store like appearance to life, with shapes and such. I know what I don't know. and after not really knowing where to begin with the Ransom Note assingment, I feel like I don't really know what I know either.

This inspired a totally new design concept WAY out of the box. i(want to)Scream. I have gathered in the roughly two weeks of code experience that this is a shared experience amongst coders.

I am excited to test my fundamental, comprehensive knowledge of basic html and css concepts. and to also build a safe, structured platform to vent out some of my favorite frustrations.

[x] I want to build a header row with some menu buttons on the bottom, centered, with a dark, vampirey theme.

<!-- Buttons will navigate the user to the Who What Where When and Why pages.

[ ]prev
[ ]home
[ ]next -->

Got rid of those buttons.

creating more content for additional pages. I've decided to only link a select few to make the hover/link feature more appealing.

Added another page. Revised fonts. Edit background color.

Next to-do:
choose 3x more pages to link.
create 3x more pages and link.
fix links between all pages.

create content for 3x pages.

double check to make sure site functions as intended.
