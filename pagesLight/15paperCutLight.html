    <p class="pageDescription">
      You were just minding your businessâ€”filing a document, opening mail,
      flipping a page in quiet confidence. Then BAM. The searing pain of
      betrayal by the thinnest assassin known to man: paper. Death by a Thousand
      Papercuts captures that precise moment of microscopic devastation in a
      flavor thatâ€™s sharp, unexpected, and unnecessarily intense.

      It starts with a bold raspberry sorbet baseâ€”bright, tart, and just acidic
      enough to remind you that pain comes in small doses. Swirled through are
      streaks of red-hot cinnamon syrup (because obviously it has to sting), and
      just when you think itâ€™s over, in come the thin, crackling shards of
      candied ginger and sugar glassâ€”sweet, spicy, and designed to attack your
      mouth when you least expect it. Hidden deep in the pint: one perfect bite
      that feels like betrayal. We wonâ€™t tell you where. Youâ€™ll know. Itâ€™s
      delicious. Itâ€™s dramatic. Itâ€™s that irrational rage you feel when
      something as innocent as stationery wounds you like a medieval dagger.
      Handle with care. Or donâ€™t. But youâ€™ve been warned.
