      At first, it seems harmless. Just one cookie. One little treat before bed.
      Youâ€™ll be careful. Youâ€™ll brush the crumbs away. You tell yourself lies.

      Crumbpocalypse is the ultimate tribute to the tiny, jagged regrets that
      ruin your sanctuary. It begins with a deceptively smooth bedtime
      buttercream baseâ€”soft, dreamy, and comforting, like freshly washed sheets.
      But woven throughout are rebellious bits of broken cookie, crushed
      crackers, and the kind of crumb clusters that defy gravity and logic by
      migrating directly under your spine. Each bite delivers a perfect contrast
      of comfort and chaos: silky sweetness laced with sharp reminders that you
      made your own crunchy little bed and now must lie in it. Notes of salted
      caramel anxiety and vanilla resignation linger long after the spoon leaves
      your mouthâ€”just like that one rogue crumb thatâ€™ll haunt your lower back
      until dawn. Served in a cozy pint with a warning label that simply reads:
      DO NOT EAT THIS IN BED. Pairs beautifully with bad decisions, a
      half-hearted attempt to dust off your sheets, and the slow erosion of
      inner peace.
