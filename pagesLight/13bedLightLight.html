    <p class="pageDescription">
      You’ve brushed your teeth. You’ve fluffed your pillows. You’ve perfectly
      burrito’d yourself into your blanket cocoon, achieving peak coziness. And
      just as your soul begins to transcend into the realm of dreams… you see
      it. The ceiling light. Still on. Mocking you.

      Lights Out (Eventually) captures that exact emotional collapse in ice
      cream form. A soothing honey vanilla base, infused with calming chamomile
      and faint notes of false security, is disrupted by swirls of “Regret
      Ripple”—a sticky, slow-moving caramel that represents the full-body sigh
      you let out when you realize you have to get up again. Hidden inside are
      chunks of crushed shortbread, representing your broken spirit, and a soft
      lavender aftertaste meant to console you while you shuffle back across the
      room like a betrayed ghost. Each bite delivers the warm, sleepy comfort of
      being in bed... followed by the cold, rude awakening of having to leave it
      because past-you didn’t plan ahead. Comes with a free tiny flashlight and
      a sense of existential exhaustion. Best enjoyed under covers, while
      angrily aiming the remote at a lamp that absolutely isn’t smart-enabled.
