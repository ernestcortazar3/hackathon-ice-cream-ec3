    <p class="pageDescription">
      You wanted a clean break. A simple peel. But noâ€”this sticker had other
      plans. Now youâ€™re 20 minutes into battle with a roll of scotch tape, half
      a bottle of rubbing alcohol, and a mounting sense of betrayal. Thatâ€™s the
      essence of Sticky Situation, an ice cream flavor designed to honor the
      heartbreak of adhesive that just wonâ€™t let go.

      At first taste, itâ€™s sweet and innocent: a creamy toffee base with ribbons
      of golden caramel that slide across your tongue like a label that almost
      peels off in one piece. But then come the clingy bitsâ€”crunchy clusters of
      chewy nougat and stubborn peanut brittle flakes that stick to your teeth
      and your soul. Just when you think youâ€™ve cleared your spoon, you find
      another one. Always another one. Subtle notes of citrus-scented cleaning
      products and desperation round out this maddeningly delicious experience,
      invoking memories of angrily scraping goo off a brand-new picture frame
      while questioning every decision that led you here. Served with a free
      wooden popsicle stick that, somehow, also leaves residue. Pairs well with
      resentment and muttered curses.
