    <p class="pageDescription">
      You left late. But you had a plan. You’d make up time. You’d hit all the
      green lights. The universe just had to cooperate. Then—red brake lights
      until the horizon and the creeping realization that you're now part of the
      very problem you screamed about five minutes ago.

      Enter Gridlock Rocky Road, the flavor of inevitability and silent
      screaming. It starts with a rich chocolate base—heavy, intense, and full
      of regret. Inside are chunks of “bad decision” brownie, swirls of
      slow-moving fudge, and crushed peanuts of anxiety—all jammed together like
      angry commuters in a six-lane bottleneck. Threaded throughout is a red
      “Road Rage Ripple,” a spicy cinnamon syrup that hits hard and lingers,
      much like your now-ruined ETA. Each spoonful delivers a powerful mix of
      chocolatey despair and marshmallowy denial, because hey—at least you
      thought you could get there on time. Served with a complimentary honk and
      a sense that someone, somewhere, is definitely driving 15 miles under the
      limit just to spite you. Best consumed with your hazard lights on and a
      podcast you’re too mad to pay attention to.
