      Introducing Clamshell Catastrophe‚Äîthe only ice cream flavor inspired by
      the modern-day trial of opening anything encased in that impossible,
      finger-slicing, soul-draining plastic fortress known as clamshell
      packaging.

      This cool, minty base starts out smooth and inviting, much like your
      optimism when you first pick up that shiny new gadget. But lurking just
      beneath the surface are sharp shards of white chocolate "plastic" and a
      blood-orange ripple of frustration, swirled with the bitter tang of
      despair and a whisper of whatever you screamed after stabbing yourself
      with scissors again. Every spoonful delivers the emotional rollercoaster
      of trying to pry open a sealed toothbrush, armed with nothing but nail
      clippers and broken dreams. That mix of rage, futility, and eventual
      surrender? It‚Äôs here. In edible form. Served in an ironically
      difficult-to-open container for authenticity. Warning: Do not attempt to
      eat while assembling furniture or contacting tech support.
