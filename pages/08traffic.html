      You're rushing, hurrying up, trying to make it. You just might. But nope,
      the interstate is backed up. You can see the brake lights for miles. You
      know you are going to be late. You know you are going to scream. You know
      you are going to scream so loud that the people in the car next to you
      will look over and wonder what is wrong with you.
