      Step in a puddle. In sneakers. Through your socks. Instantly, your entire
      day is emotionally compromised. Welcome to Soaked Soleâ€”an ice cream flavor
      that captures the clammy horror of wet socks and the creeping sense that
      nothing will ever feel right again.

      This damp and disheartening dessert starts with a cool,
      borderline-too-cold vanilla slush baseâ€”somewhere between ice cream and
      emotional purgatory. Swirled through are streaks of watered-down blueberry
      syrup, representing the vague wetness you can never locate but always
      feel. Chunks of soggy shortbread float aimlessly, like dreams that didnâ€™t
      dry properly. Thereâ€™s a hint of mintâ€”cold, but not refreshing. More like
      the sensation of your toes slowly realizing their cozy illusion has been
      brutally shattered. And just when you think itâ€™s over, there's an
      unexpected pocket of salty pretzel mushâ€”because betrayal always has
      texture. Served in a leaky-bottomed cup, with a complimentary napkin that
      will absolutely disintegrate under pressure. Best enjoyed indoors, under
      dry socks, while trying to remember happiness.
