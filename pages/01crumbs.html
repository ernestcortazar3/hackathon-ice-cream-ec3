      In the cursed kingdom of Velmira, even the smallest missteps invite
      darkness. So it was when Elric the Forlorn returned from the kitchens with
      a stolen loaf of moonbread â€” crusted with frost sugar, still warm from the
      ovens lit by wyrmfire. He devoured it greedily beneath his tattered canopy
      of silk and shadow, ignoring the ancient warnings etched into the
      bedposts: Let no crumb fall where dreams are spun. But fall they did,
      sharp and sweet, into the linen hollow where he slept. That night, the bed
      breathed. From between the sheets, pale limbs coiled like roots, birthed
      from the seed of his gluttony. A figure emerged â€” lean, faceless, clothed
      in stitched scraps of dreams abandoned by sleepers too careless to guard
      them. It whispered not with words but with the rustle of crumbs being
      ground into threadbare cotton. Elric tried to flee, but the bed had
      already claimed him, folding him into its mouth like a second pillow. The
      loaf was gone. The room was silent. And beneath the blankets, something
      began to chew.
