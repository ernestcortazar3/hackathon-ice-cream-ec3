      Why does it always land on the buttered side? The horror! The tragedy! The
      absolute nightmare of a world where buttered toast never lands buttered
      side up. This is the Buttered Toast Phenomenon, and it is a real thing
      that happens to real people every day. But fear not, for we have a
      solution! Our "Buttered Toast" ice cream flavor is here to save the day.
      It's a delicious blend of buttery goodness and creamy vanilla, with a
      sprinkle of crushed graham crackers on top. It's the perfect treat to help
      you forget about the horrors of the Buttered Toast Phenomenon.
